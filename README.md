# Python-Code-Data-Analytics-2
This repository includes all of my and my teammates code for a large 4 month long project for a senior level Data Analytics II course.
This repository includes project descriptions/guidelines, Python Code to solve the tasks challenged to my team, and explanations on our 
work. Complete Project: The entirety of this project still needs to be completed. We are currently working on the final part of this 
project, however, the guidelines for Deliverable 3 can still be found in the repository. This was a 3 Part Project that expanded in 
complexity and knowledge as the course continued throughout the semester. In this project we analyze over 720,000 different lines of data, 
consisting of 78 different predictor variables and 59 million data points to detect which variables are most vulnerable to a potential attack. 

Deliverable 1: Includes the project description, data visualization, data pre-processing, data splitting, model selection, model description,
and visual representations of our data. 

Deliverable 2: Includes the project description, data visualization, data pre-processing, data splitting, model selection, model description
, and visual representations of our data, new predictive models, representations of the results, and conclusions. 

Deliverable 3: The guidelines for the final part of this project are uploaded to the repository, however, my team and I are still completing 
the final work.
